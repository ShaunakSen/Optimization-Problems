    "The best way to discover LocalSolver is to use the built-in modeling language. It provides many mathematical operators and facilitates goal programming. The language itself, called LSP (for LocalSolver Programming language) can be both used for programming and modeling: in the same LSP program it is possible to manipulate data structures as in an imperative language and define the optimization model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, models written in LSP language are really concise and readable. They are structured around 5 predefined functions: input(), model(), param(), display(), output(). These functions, called in this order, induce the flow of the program launched by the LocalSolver executable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- input: for declaring your data or reading them from files.\n",
    "- model: for declaring your optimization model.\n",
    "- param: for parameterizing the local-search solver before running.\n",
    "- display: for displaying some info in console or in some files during the resolution.\n",
    "- output: for writing results in console or in some files, once the resolution is finished.\n",
